<p>When I first encountered Nix, it seemed magical, and not in a good way. Instructions such as “copy Firefox with all its dependencies to a remote machine with this one command” and “change these two lines in <code>configuration.nix</code>, rebuild, and now you’re running a hypervisor” were impressive but inscrutable. Here was something that claimed to solve packaging and dependency management once and for all, but what made it work? I found it very difficult to reconcile the experience of using it with the knowledge that it was just Linux at the end of the day and everything was essentially shell scripts that were being run more or less like they would be with any other packaging toolchain.</p>
<p>After more than a year of using it professionally and personally, I think I’ve narrowed it down to three methods that Nix uses to achieve its goals: hashing, environment variables, and symbolic links. Let’s go through them in order.</p>
<h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2>
<p>To build something, Nix first generates a recipe (known as a <em>derivation</em>) and then executes it, using a hash of the recipe to uniquely identify the output. The reason it does this instead of hashing the output is that most build processes don’t produce deterministic outputs and changing this would require superhuman levels of engineering effort (see <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">reproducible-builds.org</a> for more about this). The recipe includes the hashes of all dependencies, which in turn include the hashes of their dependencies, and so on. This means that Nix can cheaply check if a build has been performed before, and reuse dependencies if they are present instead of compiling the universe from source each time a build needs to happen. It also means that build outputs can be cached remotely or even built remotely, with Nix transparently copying over the inputs, running the build process, and copying the output back to your local machine.</p>
<h2 id="environment-variables">Environment Variables</h2>
<p>As much as possible, Nix uses environment variables instead of file paths to make dependencies available at build time. This is because environment variables are much easier to control and manipulate. <code>nix-build</code> sets up a sandbox with only the relevant environment variables set, and <code>nix-shell</code> works similarly, by changing the <code>$PATH</code> and associated environment variables to create a shell environment that vanishes when you don’t need it anymore. To ensure that no stray values leak into your shell, it even has a <code>--pure</code> flag that unsets them all before specifying its own.</p>
<h2 id="symbolic-links">Symbolic Links</h2>
<p>Symbolic links are important because switching the target of a symbolic link can be done atomically on all POSIX-compliant systems, and symbolic links are how Nix addresses the mismatch between its content-addressable store and the deeply ingrained assumptions everything else has about how a Linux system behaves. Nix does all its builds in a sandbox, puts the outputs in its store, and only then creates/switches a symlink pointing to the result of the build in the current directory. This means that if any phase of the build fails, the user’s working directory is unaffected, and if a symlink exists, it always points to a successful build output. NixOS takes this one step further and builds an entirely new system configuration before switching it over, which means that the system is always in a working state, even if something bad like a power outage happens.</p>
<p>What would a build tool look like without one of these pillars?</p>
<p>Without hashing, we might have build outputs that are equivalent but no way to check this, and we’d have to recompile the universe from scratch each time we wanted to do a build.</p>
<p>Without full control of environment variables, we can’t ensure that only the dependencies we specify are used to produce the build output, and our builds might complete successfully on our machine but not on another, which is no better than the current non-Nix state of affairs.</p>
<p>Without symbolic links, we might have broken build outputs and/or system configurations if intermediate files were put in place during a failed build. We wouldn’t be able to trust that a build either fails or produces a complete output and Nix would be completely unsuitable for system deployment.</p>
<p>I hope this provides some more insight into how Nix achieves its goals. I’m more confident that there’s no magic here, just difficult and tedious engineering!</p>
