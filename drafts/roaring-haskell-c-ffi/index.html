<p>Recently I thought it would be fun to try writing Haskell bindings for
a C library, which for a long time has seemed especially intimidating to me.
I’ve been intrigued by <a href="https://roaringbitmap.org/">roaring bitmaps</a> since
I first heard about them and unfortunately there doesn’t seem to be a native
Haskell implementation, but there is one in C called
<a href="https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/CRoaring">CRoaring</a> that I decided to bind
to. The specific library isn’t that important here but it turned out that
I accidentally made a good choice because CRoaring can be
<a href="https://github.com/RoaringBitmap/CRoaring#amalgamating">amalgamated</a> into
a <code>roaring.c</code> and a <code>roaring.h</code> file for easy inclusion in other projects, and
it’s usable without trying to marshall the data structure itself between
Haskell and C land so I was able to avoid opening that can of worms.</p>

what I came up with (“harimau” is Indonesian for “tiger”).</p>

<p>While looking for references to FFI best practices and working on my own
I found myself going against the grain on numerous occasions. I thought it
might be useful to mention a few of these instances, why I chose to do things
the way I did, and why I wouldn’t recommend my approach to most people using
the FFI for Real Work™.</p>
<h2 id="foreignfunctioninterface-instead-of-capiffi"><code>ForeignFunctionInterface</code> instead of <code>CApiFFI</code></h2>
<p>A recent post on the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc/blog/20210709-capi-usage.html">GHC developers’
blog</a> has a simple,
clear summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tl;dr: When importing system libraries we strongly recommend that users use GHC’s <code>capi</code> calling convention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the actual recommendation is a little more nuanced:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is justifiable to use <code>ccall</code> to avoid this runtime cost in cases where the foreign function is shipped with a package’s <code>cbits</code>, where the calling convention is clear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(The runtime cost mentioned is because the <code>capi</code> calling convention works by
constructing a C source file which defines a stub function over the desired
foreign import.)</p>
<p>As it happens, I <em>do</em> include the foreign function in my <code>cbits</code>, but in most
other situations it would make sense to follow this advice.</p>
