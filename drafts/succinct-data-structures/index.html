<p>Our data takes up too much space! Consider the linked list:</p>
<p>(picture of a linked list)</p>
<p>No matter what it stores, we need to allocate another 64 bits per node in order to keep track of where the next one is! This is especially absurd if we consider the case of a linked list of booleans. We only need one bit to store each element, but (after taking into account the overhead) storage requirements of each node are at least 65 bits, which is 65x more space than we would ideally use.</p>
<p>(picture of the same data as an array)</p>
<p>Fortunately, we don’t have to use a linked list to store this sequence. Instead we can use an array, which is a contiguous series of memory addresses. Now instead of explicitly keeping track of where the next element is, that information is implicit in the memory layout of the data. We have achieved ideal space usage! On the other hand, modifying our data is tricky, whereas with a linked list representation all we have to do is change a few pointers.</p>
<p>Replacing a linked list with an array is pretty straightforward, but what do we do if we have a more interesting data structure, such as a tree?</p>
<p>(picture of a tree with at least one node that has &gt;2 children)</p>
<p>If we had a complete binary tree, we could store it in breadth-first order, again implicitly encoding the parent-child relationships in the memory layout. With any other kind of tree, though, we can’t do this.</p>
<p>The existence of Lisp suggests one approach. We could perform a depth-first preorder traversal of the tree, producing a <code>(</code> when going from a parent to a child, and a <code>)</code> when returning to a parent from a child. This results in <code>2n</code> parentheses for a tree with <code>n</code> nodes, and is known as a Balanced Parentheses representation.</p>
<p>(balanced parentheses representation of above tree)</p>
<p>The fun really begins when we replace <code>(</code> with 1 and <code>)</code> with 0 to get a bitvector. This can be stored extremely efficiently as machine words. We can operate on this bitvector using <code>rank</code> and <code>select</code> operations. <code>rank(i)</code> counts the number of occurrences of a symbol upto and including a particular index <code>i</code>, and <code>select(i)</code> provides the index where the <code>i</code>th symbol is located.</p>
<p>Using these operations, we can perform more sophisticated queries such as determining the next sibling node or the parent node.</p>
<p>These data structures are known as compact, succinct, or implicit data structures based on how much space they take up compared to the information-theoretical lower bound. The primary advantage they have over other forms of data compression is that they do not have to be decompressed before useful work can be done with them.</p>
<p>So far this seems like a fun computer science party trick, but are there real-world applications of this body of knowledge?</p>
<p>One application is to working with semi-structured textual formats, such as CSVs and JSON. When working with these, we usually have to parse the entire document, even if we only care about a specific field. It would be nice if we could somehow create an index the data (without parsing it first) and then only pluck out the specific data that we care about. This idea of efficiently encoding the structure separately matches what we’ve seen so far, and is the subject of <a href="http://www.di.unipi.it/~ottavian/files/semi_index_cikm.pdf">“Semi-Indexing Semi-Structured Data in Tiny Space”</a> by Giuseppe Ottaviano and Roberto Grossi</p>
