<p>I struggled with Git for a long time, and every time I thought I had finally made sense of it, I would accidentally delete a repository or mess up a branch, causing me to question my grasp of what I was doing. I found it very difficult to form a mental model of the tool from the proliferation of seemingly endless command line flags that I had to use to achieve anything meaningful, and the cryptic errors that would inevitably result.</p>
<p>When I finally thought I understood what was going on, I offered to give a talk on it to the local functional group, because Git is functional, right? The co-organisers explained that it wouldn’t be an interesting or useful talk, but a talk on implementing Git in Haskell would be very welcome.</p>
<p>That was enough motivation to start working on a <a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/duffer">Git library</a>, and it turns out that understanding Git from the inside out is far, far easier than whatever I was trying to do earlier. This blog post is my attempt to share that comfort and understanding with you.</p>
<p>I’ve chosen to write this as an IHaskell notebook that is available <a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/notebooks/tree/master/git-from-scratch">here</a>, and I’ve included a <code>default.nix</code> to make things easier if you have Nix installed. You should be able to run</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="ex">nix-build</span> .
$ <span class="ex">result/bin/ihaskell-notebook</span></code></pre></div>
<p>to open a Jupyter notebook environment with all the dependencies you’ll need to follow along.</p>
<p>GHCi has a handy Vim-inspired feature where a command prefixed with <code>:!</code> is run in the shell, and IHaskell supports this as well, so I’ll be using that heavily to keep everything self-contained.</p>
<p>Let’s start by picking a Git repository. I picked Ethan Schoonover’s <a href="https://github.com/altercation/solarized/">solarized</a> because it’s nontrivial, well-known, and was last updated in 2011, so I’m confident that the hashes here won’t go out of date.</p>

<p><code>git show</code> displays the latest commit on the current branch, <code>--format=raw</code> shows it in raw format, and the <code>-s</code> flag suppresses the diff output, which (as we’ll see later) isn’t part of the commit.</p>
<p>The first thing we have to address is the fact that Git has two storage formats: loose objects and packfiles. In the loose object format, each Git object is stored in its own file under the <code>.git/objects</code> directory. In the packfile format, many Git objects are stored in a file under the <code>.git/objects/pack</code> directory with an associated pack index to make lookups feasible.</p>
<p>Loose objects are used below a certain size threshold as an on-disk format, and packfiles are used as a space optimisation and to transfer files over the network because transferring one large file has less overhead than transferring lots of small files. Loose objects are easier to work with, so I’m going to convert the packfiles into loose objects.</p>
<p>If you’d like to learn more about packfiles, my favourite resource is Aditya Mukerjee’s <a href="https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/three/unpacking-git-packfiles">Unpacking Git packfiles</a>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="co">-- `git unpack-objects` doesn&#39;t do any unpacking if the objects already exist in the repository</span>
<span class="fu">:!</span>mv <span class="fu">.</span>git<span class="fu">/</span>objects<span class="fu">/</span>pack<span class="fu">/*</span> <span class="fu">.</span>
<span class="co">-- Stream the packfiles to `git unpack-objects`, which splits them into individual objects and stores them appropriately</span>

<span class="co">-- We don&#39;t need the packfiles any more</span>
<span class="fu">:!</span>rm <span class="fu">-</span>rf pack<span class="fu">-*</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Okay, the packfiles are gone and there are only loose objects now.</p>
<p><code>git show</code> is an example of a ‘porcelain’ command for users to interact with, as opposed to a ‘plumbing’ command that is more low-level and meant for Git itself to use under the hood. The latest commit on the current branch is known as the <code>HEAD</code> commit, and we should be able to use <code>git cat-file -p</code> to get essentially the same output as before (the <code>-p</code> flag means ‘pretty-print’).</p>

<p><code>HEAD</code> is in fact a file that lives at <code>.git/HEAD</code>. Let’s view its contents.</p>

<p>As expected, we get the same output as before. On to something different: <code>e40cd4130e2a82f9b03ada1ca378b7701b1a9110</code> is a reference to an object stored at <code>.git/objects/e4/0cd4130e2a82f9b03ada1ca378b7701b1a9110</code>. The first two characters of the hash are the directory name and the 38 remaining characters are the file name underneath that directory. It’s worth pointing out that all objects are stored in this format, and there’s no separation between object types or anything like that.</p>
<p>This unusual directory structure was chosen as a tradeoff between the number of directories under <code>.git/objects</code> and the number of files under each of those directories. One approach might have been to use 40-character file names and put all objects under <code>.git/objects</code>. However, some filesystems have operations that are <code>O(n)</code> in the number of files in a directory, and working with large repositories would get very slow in this case. Another approach would have been to use the first character of the hash as the directory name, which would lead to at most 16 directories under <code>.git/objects</code>. Git settled on the first two characters, which gives us at most 256 directories.</p>
<p>Let’s confirm that the file does exist, and then look at its contents.</p>

<p>Git compresses these files with zlib before storing them, and we’ll need to handle this. Fortunately there’s a tool called <code>zlib-flate</code> (part of the <code>qpdf</code> package) that we can use.</p>

<p>This is identical to the output of <code>git cat-file -p</code>, except for the <code>commit 248</code> at the beginning. That’s a header that Git uses to tell different types of objects apart, and <code>248</code> is the content length of this particular commit. There’s also a null byte after the content length that the shell is not displaying here, and this will become important when we write code to handle the header in a moment.</p>
<p>I’m done playing with the shell for now, and I want to write some code. The first thing I’d like to do is import some libraries and define helper functions for compresssion and decompression. Haskell’s <code>zlib</code> library works with lazy bytestrings but I use strict bytestrings in the rest of this code and I don’t want to keep converting back and forth, so I’ll define <code>compress</code> and <code>decompress</code> accordingly.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">import qualified</span> <span class="dt">Codec.Compression.Zlib</span> <span class="kw">as</span> <span class="dt">Z</span> (compress, decompress)

decompress <span class="fu">=</span> toStrict <span class="fu">.</span> Z.decompress <span class="fu">.</span> fromStrict</code></pre></div>
<p>Now to recreate the <code>zlib-flate</code> output from earlier, and demonstrate the presence of that null byte in the header:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">commit <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> B.readFile <span class="st">&quot;.git/objects/e4/0cd4130e2a82f9b03ada1ca378b7701b1a9110&quot;</span>
print <span class="fu">$</span> decompress commit</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>&quot;commit 248\NULtree ecd0e58d6832566540a30dfd4878db518d5451d0\nparent ab3c5646b41de1b6d95782371289db585ba8aa85\nauthor Trevor Bramble &lt;inbox@trevorbramble.com&gt; 1372482098 -0700\ncommitter Trevor Bramble &lt;inbox@trevorbramble.com&gt; 1372482214 -0700\n\nadd tmux by @seebi!\n&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next, I want to make sense of this content by parsing it. I’ll write parsers that take a sequence of bytes and produce values I can work with. I also want to define serialisers (or unparsers, as I like to think of them) that take those values and turn them back into the sequence of bytes we started with.</p>
<p>Haskell has a couple of great options for this, and I’ve decided to go with <code>attoparsec</code>. It does the right thing and accounts for a parsing failure by default instead of blowing up with a runtime error, but I’m pretty confident that my parsers won’t fail so I’ll define a helper function that gets rid of that behaviour.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">import           </span><span class="dt">Data.Attoparsec.ByteString</span> (<span class="dt">Parser</span>)

parsed parser <span class="fu">=</span> either error id <span class="fu">.</span> AC.parseOnly parser</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s write our first parser! We’ll start with a simple one for the header. We want some sequence of characters, a space, a number, and a null byte, and parser combinators make implementing this straightforward.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">parseHeader ::</span> <span class="dt">Parser</span> (<span class="dt">ByteString</span>, <span class="dt">Int</span>)

    objectType <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> AC.takeTill AC.isSpace
    AC.space
    len <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> AC.decimal
    AC.char <span class="ch">&#39;\NUL&#39;</span>
    return (objectType, len)

parsed parseHeader commit</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>(&quot;commit&quot;,248)</code></pre>
<p>The next parser I want is one for references. The correct way to do this is to look for 40 characters that are in the range 0-9 or a-f, but I’m lazy and I’m going to just grab 40 characters instead. Rabbit hole: write a parser that only parses valid SHA1 hashes.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">type</span> <span class="dt">Ref</span> <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">ByteString</span>

<span class="ot">parseHexRef ::</span> <span class="dt">Parser</span> <span class="dt">Ref</span>
parseHexRef <span class="fu">=</span> AC.take <span class="dv">40</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We now have all the smaller parsers we’ll need to plug together in order to parse a commit. We want to parse the <code>tree</code>, any number of <code>parent</code>s, an <code>author</code>, a <code>committer</code>, and a message. Why any number of parents? The initial commit of a repository won’t have any parents, and merge commits will have at least two, although there can be more (this is known as an <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/blog/2017/the-biggest-and-weirdest-commits-in-linux-kernel-git-history">octopus merge</a>).</p>
<p>The author and committer lines consist of a user’s name, their email, the unix timestamp, and the timezone. A better parser for this would validate each of those components, but to demonstrate I’m just going to grab the whole line. Rabbit hole: write the better person+time parser.</p>
<p>One thing I really like about parser combinators is that I can write a parser whose form imitates the content I’m trying to parse. This is purely a cute stylistic quirk, but I enjoy doing it anyway.</p>

<p>Now to write our first serialiser that takes values of the Commit type and turns them back into bytestrings.

<p>Great, it looks like that does the right thing. We’ll test it more thoroughly later.</p>
<p>So far I’ve avoided the question of where the hashes come from. Git is a content-addressable store (CAS) and the content of our Git objects uniquely determines their hash. This is very much like a hash table, and that’s a useful way to think about Git: a hashtable on the filesystem.</p>
<p>More specifically, the SHA1 hash of a Git object before compression is used as the reference. Let me demonstrate.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Data.Digest.Pure.SHA</span>

<span class="ot">hash ::</span> <span class="dt">ByteString</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Ref</span>

<pre><code>e40cd4130e2a82f9b03ada1ca378b7701b1a9110</code></pre>
<p>This is the same hash as the one we’ve been using to get at the commit so far, which is consistent with my explanation.</p>
<p>I think this is a good point to mention that Git commits form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a>, and this property is ensured by the way hashes are computed: since a commit hash depends on the content of the <code>parent</code> fields, a commit with an ancestor referring back to it would somehow need that ancestor (and therefore all its successors) to know the final commit hash <em>before it has been determined</em>. However, since SHA1 has recently been <a href="https://shattered.io/">broken in practice</a>, it might be eventually possible to generate a Git commit cycle and I’m curious to see how the tool would behave in its presence.</p>
<p>Now that we’re done with commits, let’s look at trees. A tree is what Git calls a directory listing. I think the tree reference <code>ecd0e58d6832566540a30dfd4878db518d5451d0</code> in the above commit is a good one to start with.</p>
<p>A tree object consists of some number of tree entries, and each tree entry represents a directory/file, with a reference to another Git object that stores the actual content of the directory/file. I think of these as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">tries</a>, with file contents at the leaves.</p>

<p>The number at the beginning of each entry represents the entry permissions, and is a subset of Unix file permissions. <code>100644</code> corresponds to a blob, which is the Git object corresponding to a file, and <code>040000</code> corresponds to a tree. Other numbers exist but are uncommon. The rest of the tree entry is the entry reference and the entry name.</p>
<p>As before, we should be able to decompress the file and get essentially the same output as before, right?</p>

<p>Although this looks very much like gibberish, it is the same content as above with one big difference: instead of the 40-byte hexadecimal representation of a SHA1 hash, the 20-byte representation is used. The <code>tree &lt;length&gt;</code> header is present, as is the entry permission. Each entry name is followed by a <code>\NUL</code> to facilitate parsing.</p>
<p>We are now able to define a parser for tree objects. Rabbit hole: the tree entries need to be sorted in a certain quirky order, and we would like to disallow duplicates. Use a different data structure and manual <code>Ord</code> definitions to ensure this.</p>

The list of all \ncurrently included ports, highlighted items are new, updates noted:\n\n#### Editors &amp; IDEs\n\n*   \\[UPDATED\\] **Vim**\n*   \\[NEW\\] ***Emacs***\n*   \\[NEW\\] ***IntelliJ IDEA***\n*   \\[NEW\\] ***NetBeans***\n*   \\[NEW\\] ***SeeStyle theme for Coda &amp; SubEthaEdit***\n*   \\[NEW\\] ***TextMate***\n*   \\[NEW\\] ***Visual Studio***\n\n#### Terminal Emulators\n\n* \\[UPDATED\\] **iTerm2 colorschemes**\n* \\[UPDATED\\] **OS X Terminal.app colors**\n* \\[UPDATED\\] **Xresources colors**\n\n#### Other Applications\n\n* \\[UPDATED\\] **Mutt mail client colorschemes**\n\n#### Palettes\n\n* \\[UPDATED\\] **Adobe Photoshop Swatches**\n* \\[UPDATED\\] **Apple Color Picker Palette**\n* \\[UPDATED\\] **Gimp Palette**\n\n\n### Critical Changes\n\nThese changes may require you to change your configuration.\n\n*   **GLOBAL : IMPROVEMENT : New red accent color value**\n    Modified red from L\\*a\\*b lightness value 45 to 50 to bring it in\n    line with the other accent colors and address bleed into dark background on \n    some displays, as well as reducing shift of red against base03 when viewed \n    with glasses (chromatic aberration). All instances of the colorscheme and \n    palettes updated to new red and avalailable for use/import without further \n    modification. Forks and ports should pull new changes and/or update ported \n    red value accordingly.  The new red:\n\n            red #dc322f\n\n*   **VIM : CHANGE : Default mode now 16 color**\n    Default terminal mode is now ***16 colors***. Most of the users of terminal \n    mode seem comfortabel and capable changing terminal colors. This is the \n    preferred method of implementing Solarized in Terminal mode. If you wish to \n    instead use the degraded 256 color palette, you may do so with the \n    following line in your .vimrc:\n\n            let g:solarized_termcolors=256\n\n    You no longer need to specify \&quot;let g:solarized_termcolors=16\&quot; as it is now \n    the default; leaving it in your .vimrc won&#39;t hurt anything, however.\n\n*   **VIM : IMPROVEMENT : New Toggle Background Plugin**\n    Added new Toggle Background plugin. Will load automatically and show up as \n    a menu item in the `Window` menu in gui vim. Automatically maps to\n    `&lt;F5&gt;` if available (won&#39;t clobber that mapping if you&#39;re using it).\n    Also available as a command `:ToggleBG`.  To manually map to\n    something other than `&lt;F5&gt;`:\n\n    To set your own mapping in your .vimrc file, simply add the following line \n    to support normal, insert and visual mode usage, changing the\n    \&quot;`&lt;F5&gt;`\&quot; value to the key or key combination you wish to use:\n\n        call togglebg#map(\&quot;&lt;F5&gt;\&quot;)\n\n    Note that you&#39;ll want to use a single function key or equivalent if you want \n    the plugin to work in all modes (normal, insert, visual).\n\n*   **VIM : IMPROVEMENT : Special &amp; Non-text items now more visible**\n    Special characters such as trailing whitespace, tabs, newlines, when \n    displayed using \&quot;:set list\&quot; can be set to one of three levels depending on \n    your needs.\n\n            let g:solarized_visibility =  \&quot;normal\&quot;|   \&quot;high\&quot; or \&quot;low\&quot;\n\n    I&#39;ll be honest: I still prefer low visibility. I like them barely there.  \n    They show up in lines that are highlighted as by the cursor line, which \n    works for me. If you are with me on this, put the following in your .vimrc:\n\n            let g:solarized_visibility =  \&quot;low\&quot;\n\n### Non Critical Changes\n\nThese changes should not impact your usage of the Solarized.\n\n*   **PALETTES : IMPROVEMENT : Colorspace tagged and untagged versions**\n    Changed default OS X color picker palatte swatches to tagged colors (sRGB) \n    and included alternate palette with untagged color swatches for advanced \n    users (v1.0.0beta1 had untagged as default).\n\n*   **VIM : BUGFIX : Better display in Terminal.app, other emulators**\n    Terminal.app and other common terminal emulators that report 8 color mode \n    had display issues due to order of synt highlighting definitions and color \n    values specified. These have been conformed and reordered in such a way \n    that there is a more graceful degrading of the Solarized color palette on \n    8 color terminals. Infact, the experience should be almost identical to gui \n    other than lack of bold typeface.\n\n*   **VIM : BUGFIX : Better distinction between status bar and split windows**\n    Status bar was previously too similar to the cursor line and window splits.  \n    This has now been changed significantly to improve the clarity of what is \n    status, cursor line and window separator.\n\n*   **VIM : STREAMLINED : Removed simultaneous gui/cterm definitions**\n*   Refactored solarized.vim to eliminate simultaneous definition of gui and \n    cterm values.\n\n*   **VIM : BUGFIX : Removed italicized front in terminal mode**\n    Removed default italicized font in terminal mode in the Solarized Vim\n    colorscheme (many terminal emulators display Vim italics as reversed type).  \n    Italics still used in GUI mode by default and can still be turned off in \n    both modes by setting a variable: `let g:solarized_italic=0`.\n\n1.0.0beta1\n----------\n\nFirst public release. Included:\n\n* Adobe Photoshop Swatches\n* Apple Color Picker Palette\n* Gimp Palette\n* iTerm2 colorschemes\n* Mutt mail client colorschemes\n* OS X Terminal.app colors\n* Vim Colorscheme\n* Xresources colors\n\n\n\n***\n\nMODIFIED: 2011 Apr 16\n&quot;}</code></pre>

<p>Finally we move to Git tags, which are a way to associate a name with a reference. Git has a handy <code>show-ref --tags</code> command we can use to list them:</p>

<p>There are two types of tags: lightweight tags and annotated tags. Lightweight tags are just files very much like <code>refs/heads/master</code> containing a ref, and annotated tags have a message associated with them like a commit. Only annotated tags are Git objects.</p>

hashObject <span class="fu">=</span> hash <span class="fu">.</span> toBytes</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s do a quick test to check that our definitions work.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">hashObject <span class="fu">.</span> parsed parseGitObject <span class="fu">.</span> decompress <span class="fu">&lt;$&gt;</span> B.readFile <span class="st">&quot;.git/objects/31/ff7f5064824d2231648119feb6dfda1a3c89f5&quot;</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>31ff7f5064824d2231648119feb6dfda1a3c89f5</code></pre>
<p>Excellent, although we are lacking a helper to turn a reference into a Git object filepath. Let’s define that.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">System.FilePath</span> ((&lt;/&gt;))

<span class="ot">refPath ::</span> FilePath <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Ref</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> FilePath
refPath gitDir ref <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">let</span>
   (dir,file) <span class="fu">=</span> splitAt <span class="dv">2</span> (toString ref)
   <span class="kw">in</span> gitDir <span class="fu">&lt;/&gt;</span> <span class="st">&quot;objects&quot;</span> <span class="fu">&lt;/&gt;</span> dir <span class="fu">&lt;/&gt;</span> file

refPath <span class="st">&quot;.git&quot;</span> <span class="st">&quot;31ff7f5064824d2231648119feb6dfda1a3c89f5&quot;</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>&quot;.git/objects/31/ff7f5064824d2231648119feb6dfda1a3c89f5&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now we can define a <code>readObject</code> action that takes a reference and returns a parsed Git object.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">readObject ::</span> FilePath <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Ref</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">IO</span> <span class="dt">GitObject</span>
readObject gitDir ref <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
    <span class="kw">let</span> path <span class="fu">=</span> refPath gitDir ref
    content <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> decompress <span class="fu">&lt;$&gt;</span> B.readFile path
    return <span class="fu">$</span> parsed parseGitObject content

readObject <span class="st">&quot;.git&quot;</span> <span class="st">&quot;31ff7f5064824d2231648119feb6dfda1a3c89f5&quot;</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>GitTag (Tag {tagObject = &quot;90581c7bfbcd279768580eec595d0ab3c094cc02&quot;, tagType = &quot;commit&quot;, tagTag = &quot;v1.0.0beta1&quot;, tagTagger = &quot;Ethan Schoonover &lt;es@ethanschoonover.com&gt; 1300994142 -0700&quot;, tagAnnotation = &quot;Initial public beta release 1.0.0beta1\n&quot;})</code></pre>
<p>Next we define a <code>writeObject</code> action that takes a Git object and stores it under the right path if it doesn’t already exist. The “doesn’t already exist” bit is the magic of Git: we can safely assume that an object with the same hash is the same object. Every time a tree or blob changes, only the changed objects are written to the disk, and this is how Git manages to be space-efficient.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">System.Directory</span> (doesPathExist, createDirectoryIfMissing)
<span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">System.FilePath</span>  (takeDirectory)
<span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Control.Monad</span>    (when, unless)

<span class="ot">writeObject ::</span> FilePath <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">GitObject</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">IO</span> <span class="dt">Ref</span>
writeObject gitDir object <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
    <span class="kw">let</span> ref  <span class="fu">=</span>  hashObject object
    <span class="kw">let</span> path <span class="fu">=</span>  refPath gitDir ref
    exists   <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> doesPathExist path
    unless exists <span class="fu">$</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
        <span class="kw">let</span> dir <span class="fu">=</span> takeDirectory path
        createDirectoryIfMissing <span class="dt">True</span> dir
        B.writeFile path <span class="fu">.</span> compress <span class="fu">$</span> toBytes object
    return ref</code></pre></div>
<p>Okay, time for the grand finale! We’re going to read and then write every object in this Git repository. If we’ve implemented everything correctly, the number of references before and after will be unchanged, and they will be the same references.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Data.Traversable</span> (for)

<p>And that’s essentially all there is to Git! I’ve skipped over most of the additional quirks, features, and optimisations but I hope I’ve established that even with the relatively small amount of code above you can implement a working and usable Git API.</p>
<p>You’ll notice that one thing I haven’t mentioned at all is diffing or merging. That’s because Git doesn’t store diffs! They are computed on the fly when you ask for them. The packfile format does do diffing as a space optimisation, but I think it’s important to point out that you can have a perfectly cromulent implementation without them because that is what surprised me the most when I learned this for the first time.</p>
<p>A good mental model of Git empowered me to use it better. I’d heard that binary files and Git don’t go well together, but I only understood why recently: Git stores every version of every file, and binary files don’t compress very well (unlike text files), so they take up huge amounts of space. I’d also read about <a href="https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/issues/4989#issuecomment-193772935">CocoaPods causing issues for GitHub</a>, and now I know that this is because the tree objects representing the <code>Specs</code> directory were very large and constantly getting updated, leading to a lot of stress on GitHub’s servers.</p>
<p>What else can you do with this power? You can…</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/git-internals-workshop">Craft your own repositories</a></li>
<li>Run analytics on your commit graph when <code>git log</code> won’t cut it!</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/suppandi">Write a web API for your repository!</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mirage/irmin">Use Git as the backend of your application and get diffing/merging for free!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>If you’d like to learn more, you’re in luck! writing on this topic is plentiful and of extremely high quality. I started with the Git Book’s <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-Objects">chapter on Git Internals</a> and referred frequently to Vincent Hanquez’s <a href="https://github.com/vincenthz/hs-git/">hs-git</a> and Stefan Saasen’s <a href="http://stefan.saasen.me/articles/git-clone-in-haskell-from-the-bottom-up/">overwhelmingly thorough article</a> that implements enough of Git to do a <code>git clone</code> (!). Other resources include Mary Rose Cook’s excellent <a href="https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-from-the-inside-out">Git from the inside out</a> and <a href="http://gitlet.maryrosecook.com/docs/gitlet.html">Gitlet</a> as well as John Wiegley’s <a href="https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/">Git from the Bottom Up</a>. If nothing else, I hope the sheer proliferation of Git innards writing is enough to convince you that this is a useful and rewarding approach to learning about it.</p>

<p>There are many reasons to start contributing to open source:</p>
<ul>
<li>to give back to the community</li>
<li>to fix a bug in software you depend on</li>
<li>warm fuzzies</li>
</ul>
<p>But you don’t always have the time or energy to understand a new codebase well enough to make a meaningful change to it. And even if you do, it’s not clear that this is the best use of your time.</p>
<p>Your pull request might linger untouched for months, like the source control equivalent of shouting into the void. Alternatively, the maintainer might be having a bad day and dismiss your pull request or expect you to do some arcane Git voodoo to bring it up to their exacting standards. All this can turn the gift of patches into a boring and unpleasant chore.</p>
<p>For a long time I mistakenly believed the the only <strong>real</strong> contributions were those that included code to fix bugs or add new features. Eventually I realised there were simpler ways of getting my name in commit logs and my open source contributions vastly increased.</p>
<p>I decided to focus on easy pull requests as a precursor to, or instead of, engaging more fully with a project. What do I mean by this?</p>
<h2 id="documentation-and-typo-fixes">Documentation and typo fixes</h2>
<p>Lindsey Kuper has <a href="http://composition.al/blog/2013/05/31/one-character-patches/">a great post on these</a>. They are my favourite because I am a pedant. Witness <a href="https://github.com/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaibhavsagar+is%3Aclosed+README">the absurd number of README updates</a> I have to my name. They’re as easy as noticing a typo, clicking the pencil icon, and fixing it. Editing project documentation is similarly straightforward.</p>
<p>This is the quickest way I know of to contribute and gauge a project’s health at the same time. If your typo fix doesn’t get merged quickly, then a more substantial change probably won’t either and you’ll have found that out quickly.</p>
<h2 id="linter-suggestions">Linter suggestions</h2>
<p>One day I decided to run HLint, a Haskell linter, on a couple of projects and open PRs accordingly. I had <a href="https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Avaibhavsagar+HLint+is%3Aclosed">mixed results</a>.</p>
<p>This technique isn’t Haskell specific, and I think it is especially well-suited to Python and Go projects where there is a ‘blessed’ style to work off and tools like <code>flake8</code> and <code>gofmt</code> are available.</p>
<p>If your change gets accepted, then you’ll be improving code quality and paving the way for future contributors. If it doesn’t, then you might have a discussion about good style that might lead to a documentation PR! If the maintainers are hostile, then you’re probably better off elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="automated-testing">Automated testing</h2>
<p>I’m a big fan of automation, and I’d consider it one of the themes of this blog. A large number of projects don’t have good automated test suites, and even those that do sometimes let their CI setup rot over time. If this is the case, setting up Travis or Circle CI is a low-effort (if occasionally high-frustration) way of vastly improving a project. If information about how to test a specific project isn’t readily available, this is also a great opportunity for a README update (see above).</p>
<p>Again: if you don’t get a quick response, or at least a positive one, I think it’s a good sign that this project is not worth your time and at least you won’t have put a ton of effort into finding that out.</p>
<p>Of course, these aren’t the only types of easy contributions you can make: other ideas are documenting the undocumented, adding or refactoring tests, and using the issue tracker to call attention to bugs. Neil Mitchell has a great presentation on <a href="http://ndmitchell.com/downloads/slides-drive-by_haskell_contributions-09_jun_2017.pdf">‘Drive-by Haskell Contributions’</a>, although the general approach is applicable to your programming language of choice.</p>
<p>I hope I’ve given you a few ideas about contributing to open source and how you can make effective use of your time, and I’d love to see more easy pull requests by you!</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a>, <a href="https://haroldtreen.com/">Harold Treen</a>, and <a href="http://digitalfreepen.com">Rudi Chen</a> for comments and feedback.</p>

<p>I’d like to tell you about an algorithm that I’m frankly annoyed I didn’t discover earlier.</p>
<p>The algorithm is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm">Tarjan’s Strongly Connected Components</a> (or SCCs) algorithm, and as the name suggests, it decomposes a directed graph into its strongly connected components. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph</a> is one where the edges have a direction associated with them, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component">strongly connected component</a> of a graph is a subgraph where each node can be reached from every other node, i.e. there’s a directed cycle somewhere in this subgraph.</p>
<style>
img[src*='#center'] {
    display: block;
    margin: auto;
}
p.caption {
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 80%;
}
</style>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Scc.png#center" alt="Strongly Connected Components" />
<p class="caption">Strongly Connected Components</p>
</div>
<p>So why does this matter? I don’t recall ever having the desire to deeply know the SCCs of a particular graph.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a different problem. Given a directed graph, how do we know if it is acyclic? The context here is that I was wondering how difficult it would be literally draw a Git commit history as a graph and render that to a repo. Git commits form a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">directed acyclic graph</a> (DAG), which is a directed graph without cycles, and I wanted to validate a user-drawn graph as well as process it.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Tred-G.svg#center" alt="Directed Acyclic Graph" />
<p class="caption">Directed Acyclic Graph</p>
</div>
<p>Consulting <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/583876/how-do-i-check-if-a-directed-graph-is-acyclic">the oracle</a> yielded the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological sort</a>, which is where vertices are ordered such that for all vertices <em>u</em> and <em>v</em>, if there is an edge from <em>u</em> to <em>v</em>, <em>u</em> appears earlier than <em>v</em> in the sorted output. The directed edges for a Git commit graph are in the opposite direction from what we want though, because they point from children to parents. What we really want is a reverse topological sort. It would also be nice if I could somehow highlight the subgraphs of an invalid graph that are responsible for it being invalid.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c6/Topological_Ordering.svg#center" alt="Topological Sort" />
<p class="caption">Topological Sort</p>
</div>
<p>This is where we come back to the SCCs of a graph. If there are any SCCs of more than one vertex, the graph is not a DAG and those SCCs are the cause of this. Collapsing the SCCs of a directed graph to a single vertex always leads to a DAG and this is known as the condensation of a directed graph, which I think is a nice way to visualise the relationship between SCCs and DAGs.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Graph_Condensation.svg#center" alt="Condensation" />
<p class="caption">Condensation</p>
</div>
<p>Alright, so we do actually want to know the SCCs of this graph, but first we want to try to sort it topologically and reverse that order if that is possible, otherwise we calculate the SCCs and identify the offending ones. This seems a bit messy for graph properties that seem somewhat related. How cool would it be if there were an algorithm that could calculate the SCCs and a reverse topological sort for us <em>at the same time</em>?</p>
<p>It turns out that Tarjan’s SCCs algorithm does exactly that! You’d think that its performance might not be great because it does two things at once, but it is linear in the number of edges and vertices, and has better constant factors than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju&#39;s_algorithm">Kosaraju’s algorithm</a>, which only computes SCCs. Here it is as pseudocode:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode noweb"><code class="sourceCode noweb"> algorithm tarjan is
  input: graph G = (V, E)
  output: set of strongly connected components (sets of vertices)

  index := 0
  S := empty array
  for each v in V do
    if (v.index is undefined) then
      strongconnect(v)
    end if
  end for

  function strongconnect(v)
    // Set the depth index for v to the smallest unused index
    v.index := index
    v.lowlink := index
    index := index + 1
    S.push(v)
    v.onStack := true

    // Consider successors of v
    for each (v, w) in E do
      if (w.index is undefined) then
        // Successor w has not yet been visited; recurse on it
        strongconnect(w)
        v.lowlink  := min(v.lowlink, w.lowlink)
      else if (w.onStack) then
        // Successor w is in stack S and hence in the current SCC
        // Note: The next line may look odd - but is correct.
        // It says w.index not w.lowlink; that is deliberate and from the original paper
        v.lowlink  := min(v.lowlink, w.index)
      end if
    end for

    // If v is a root node, pop the stack and generate an SCC
    if (v.lowlink = v.index) then
      start a new strongly connected component
      repeat
        w := S.pop()
        w.onStack := false
        add w to current strongly connected component
      while (w != v)
      output the current strongly connected component
    end if
  end function</code></pre></div>
<p>The algorithm does a depth-first search, keeping track of two properties for each vertex: when it was encountered (the <em>index</em>) and the lowest index of any vertex reachable from this vertex (the <em>lowlink</em>). It pushes vertices on to a stack as it goes and outputs a strongly connected component when it cannot find any vertices it has not seen before.</p>
<p>As presented it is very imperative and I like Haskell, but fortunately <a href="/blog/2017/05/29/imperative-haskell/">imperative Haskell</a> is pretty straightforward and I have an implementation <a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/courses/blob/master/algorithms1/week4/SCC.ipynb">here</a>.</p>
<p>This seems like an incredibly niche use case, but validating and processing DAGs in this way happens surprisingly frequently. Consider a build process where inputs and outputs are nodes and their relationships are directed edges. The presence of an SCC with more than one vertex indicates a cyclic dependency, and dependencies need to be built before the nodes that they depend on, which implies a reverse topological sort. This generalises to dataflow programming, where loops need to be identified (and usually eliminated). I like to think of this algorithm as an all-in-one DAG toolkit.</p>
<p>We can also use it to solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-satisfiability">2SAT</a>, which is the problem of determining whether boolean variables in series of constraints of the form <code>a || b</code> can be assigned T and F values such that all constraints hold. This is discussed <a href="">here</a> but boils down to encoding the constraints as nodes and edges, calculating the SCCs, and processing the output in reverse topologically sorted order. An advantage to doing it this way is that the process can stop at the first SCC that indicates unsatisfiability. I have an implementation of this <a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/courses/blob/master/algorithms2/week6/Week6.ipynb">here</a>.</p>
<p>Discovering this algorithm got me excited about theoretical computer science and reminded me that algorithms can be fun, interesting, and an opportunity to marvel at the music of the spheres. I’m curious to know what other equally awesome algorithms are out there. Which one’s your favourite?</p>

<p><em>This post covers essentially the same material as a 5-minute presentation I gave at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=5ac465e5d3396a7e491e42afac4c5c90">RC</a>, because giving that talk over and over again doesn’t scale and there are things I would like to cover that are difficult within that time limit.</em></p>
<p>I was working through Tim Roughgarden’s <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithm-design-analysis/">Algorithms 1</a> (which has now been replaced by two smaller courses) and attempting to do all the exercises in Haskell when I bumped up against an uncomfortable truth. Haskell’s ‘quicksort’:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">qsort []     <span class="fu">=</span> []
qsort (x<span class="fu">:</span>xs) <span class="fu">=</span> lt <span class="fu">++</span> [x] <span class="fu">++</span> gt
    <span class="kw">where</span> lt <span class="fu">=</span> qsort [e <span class="fu">|</span> e <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> xs, e <span class="fu">&lt;</span>  x]
          gt <span class="fu">=</span> qsort [e <span class="fu">|</span> e <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> xs, e <span class="fu">&gt;=</span> x]</code></pre></div>
<p>isn’t a true quicksort! Specifically, it doesn’t sort the elements in place, and the assignment I was working on involved counting the number of comparisons, so I couldn’t get away with my fake quicksort. With my tail between my legs, I gave up on my pure Haskell approach and implemented a solution in Python:</p>

<p>This implementation is not particularly Pythonic: note the recursion limit and the use of a global variable. I actually forgot to reset the variable to 0 between iterations, which was fun to track down. But it works!</p>
<p>So far, so good. This isn’t something we’d be able to do in Haskell, right? And even if we could, the equivalent implementation would be so different as to be unrecognisable. At least this is what I thought until I took a closer look at <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.1.0/docs/Control-Monad-ST.html">Control.Monad.ST</a> and <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.1.0/docs/Data-STRef.html">Data.STRef</a>.</p>
<p>One of my biggest gripes with Haskell is the quality of the documentation. <code>Control.Monad.ST</code> is introduced as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This library provides support for strict state threads, as described in the PLDI ’94 paper by John Launchbury and Simon Peyton Jones <em>Lazy Functional State Threads</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and <code>Data.STRef</code> is introduced as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mutable references in the (strict) ST monad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t want to read a paper to figure out how to use these libraries, and in fact I don’t have to! In recognition of this, I humbly present alternative descriptions for <code>Control.Monad.ST</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You asked for mutable state, here it is!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and <code>Data.STRef</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Variables that you can actually vary!!!1!1!one!1eleventyone</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Code utilising these libraries can look very familiar to people used to imperative languages, e.g. past me. Here’s the above quicksort rewritten in Haskell:</p>

<p>This is roughly the same length as the Python implementation, and even improves on it in some ways: no recursion limit fiddling and no global variables.</p>
<p>If we can write Haskell that resembles Python, and Python is executable pseudocode, can we cut out the middleman and translate pseudocode directly to Haskell? Let’s take a look at another problem.</p>
<p>I needed to calculate the size of the strongly connected components of a graph for another assignment, and I decided to use Tarjan’s Strongly Connected Components algorithm. The pseudocode for that (as taken from Wikipedia) is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode noweb"><code class="sourceCode noweb"> algorithm tarjan is
  input: graph G = (V, E)
  output: set of strongly connected components (sets of vertices)

  index := 0
  S := empty array
  for each v in V do
    if (v.index is undefined) then
      strongconnect(v)
    end if
  end for

  function strongconnect(v)
    // Set the depth index for v to the smallest unused index
    v.index := index
    v.lowlink := index
    index := index + 1
    S.push(v)
    v.onStack := true

    // Consider successors of v
    for each (v, w) in E do
      if (w.index is undefined) then
        // Successor w has not yet been visited; recurse on it
        strongconnect(w)
        v.lowlink  := min(v.lowlink, w.lowlink)
      else if (w.onStack) then
        // Successor w is in stack S and hence in the current SCC
        // Note: The next line may look odd - but is correct.
        // It says w.index not w.lowlink; that is deliberate and from the original paper
        v.lowlink  := min(v.lowlink, w.index)
      end if
    end for

    // If v is a root node, pop the stack and generate an SCC
    if (v.lowlink = v.index) then
      start a new strongly connected component
      repeat
        w := S.pop()
        w.onStack := false
        add w to current strongly connected component
      while (w != v)
      output the current strongly connected component
    end if
  end function</code></pre></div>

<p>Aside from explicitly declaring our variables and passing them around, I think this looks pretty close.</p>
<p>How do we square this with Haskell’s reputation for purity and referential transparency? That’s the subject of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/lazy-functional-state-threads/">the paper mentioned above</a> that you don’t have to read (but totally can if you want)! They figured out a way to provide a principled pure interface to mutable state by passing the references as arguments into each function that makes use of them and leveraging the type system to make sure any impurity is well contained. The correctness of this approach was <a href="http://iris-project.org/pdfs/2017-icfp-runST-submission.pdf">very recently verified</a>. If desired, we can replace any of the functions with purer and more idiomatic definitions without changing the output, and that satisfies the definition of referential transparency!</p>
<p>Why don’t we do this all the time, when Haskell is at least a serviceable imperative language? Because writing imperative programs is hard! They don’t compose as well, have less useful type signatures, and are harder to reason about. Getting away from those things is why we have Haskell to begin with! The real question should be: how can we avoid doing things this way as much as possible?</p>
<p>Before I discovered this part of Haskell, I had this perception of Haskell (and declarative programming more generally) as “imperative programming but less” from a practical perspective. I thought that although writing declarative code in Python was purely (heh) a matter of discipline, writing imperative code in Haskell required completely reconceptualising the algorithm. Thanks to <code>ST</code>, I now know that this not the case, which is a huge relief. If required, I can do a literal translation of the algorithm, and clean it up (or not) later. In fact Haskell is “imperative programming and more”, and that’s awesome!</p>

</div>

<p>I’ve been trying to wrap my head around continuations for a while. I was reading <a href="https://github.com/quchen/articles/blob/master/cont_monad.md">David Luposchainsky’s excellent article</a> on them and playing with his definitions in an IHaskell notebook when I found that typed holes are an excellent hammer to attack this particular nail with.</p>
<p>If you haven’t encountered them before, <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/Typed_holes">typed holes</a> are a feature where you put one or more variables starting with <code>_</code> on the right hand side of a definition to get GHC to tell you the type of the value that fits in that hole, and you can narrow the hole as necessary to get the type of a subexpression until you have enough information to complete the definition. I like to think of this as a way of collaboratively filling in a definition with the compiler, instead of my usual approach which is to write a definition, listen carefully to GHC’s complaints, and amend my definition accordingly. Typed holes are fully supported by GHCi and the full suite of editor integrations, but I personally find the edit/reload/squint cycle more tedious than coming up with the definition in IHaskell and then moving it to a module and adding type signatures after I’m satisfied that it works.</p>
<p>I think his type definition makes an excellent starting point:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">newtype</span> <span class="dt">Cont</span> r a <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Cont</span> {<span class="ot"> (&gt;&gt;-) ::</span> (a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> r) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> r }</code></pre></div>
<p>This defines a type <code>Cont</code> with an infix constructor <code>&gt;&gt;-</code> (that looks suspiciously similar to <code>&gt;&gt;=</code>) that takes a function from <code>a</code> to <code>r</code> and provides an <code>r</code>. One intuition for what this means is that a value of this type knows about an <code>a</code> but for whatever reason refuses to be upfront about it and demands to know what you’re going to do with it and then does it for you, providing you with a final result <code>r</code>. Another intuition is that this is a generalisation of callbacks: a value of this type expects a callback to utilise the <code>a</code>. Anyway, on to my favourite part of working with mysterious data types: defining <code>Functor</code>, <code>Applicative</code>, and <code>Monad</code> instances for them! If you’ve done this before, you’ll know that these typeclasses have certain laws that their instances are meant to obey, and it turns out that this type is polymorphic enough that we can just follow the typed holes and the resulting definitions will be lawful. You don’t have to take my word for it and should verify this for yourself, but I won’t be discussing the laws here. Let’s begin!</p>

<p>In general, we know all of our definitions will be of the form <code>Cont $ \k -&gt; _</code> and that’s a safe starting point. We now know that we need to use <code>k</code> on the result of applying <code>f</code> to some <code>a</code> to finally result in an <code>r</code>, but where does the <code>a</code> come from? The only thing we can do at this point is ‘unwrap’ the <code>cont</code> using <code>&gt;&gt;-</code>. What happens when we do that?</p>

<li>an <code>a</code> (<code>a'</code>)</li>
<li>a function from <code>a</code> to <code>b</code> (<code>f'</code>)</li>
<li>a function from <code>b</code> to <code>r</code> (<code>k</code>)</li>

<p>And that’s it! The <a href="http://blog.sigfpe.com/2008/12/mother-of-all-monads.html">mother of all monads</a> boils down to some tedious and almost mechanical wrapping and unwrapping. I think it’s cool how mundane it is.</p>
<p>Let’s have a crack at something more involved. A lot of the magic in continuations is accessed via <code>callCC</code>, which takes a function and calls it with the current continuation, hence the name. How would we define it?</p>

<p>Our definition involves <code>b</code>, but the only <code>b</code> we have available is wrapped up in <code>f</code>. We need to provide an argument of a certain type to <code>f</code>, and then unwrap the result of that? Time to bring out the big guns: multiple typed holes!</p>

<p>A closer look at the definition reveals that <code>k'</code> is unused, and this function provides <code>f</code> with the option to exit early if desired, or continue as normal. There’s a good explanation of why and how this works at <a href="https://github.com/quchen/articles/blob/master/cont_monad.md#special-api-function-callcc">the aforementioned article</a>.</p>
<p>Still a bit wary? That’s fair. I like to poke at the definitions, <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-0.4.3.0/docs/src/Control-Monad-Trans-Cont.html">read the source</a>, look at how Gabriel Gonzales <a href="http://www.haskellforall.com/2014/04/how-continuation-monad-works.html">explains it</a>, and have a cup of tea and think about life for a while. Whatever works for you!</p>
<p>If you looked at the source, you might have noticed something interesting: The definition for the ContT monad transformer is identical! Here it is below.</p>

<p>I love being able to interact with these definitions like this. This is really how I want to program, and I’d encourage you to try it! The notebook is <a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/notebooks/blob/master/continuations/Continuation.ipynb">here</a> for you to play with if you have IHaskell set up. IHaskell isn’t just useful for programming: I even used it to <a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/notebooks/blob/master/continuations/DiscoveringContinuationsWithTypedHoles.ipynb">write this blog post</a>!</p>
<p>I feel like I should end with something profound about continuations, but I’ll instead link you to <a href="http://teh.id.au/posts/2017/05/10/lambdajam-slides/index.html">this presentation by Tim Humphries</a> and once again nudge you to try typed holes the next time you’re in a Haskell bind (pun very much intended).</p>

</div>

<p>You wouldn’t know it from looking at my blog, but I attended a batch at the Recurse Center from August to early November last year, and it was the best experience of my life. Many Recursers write a return statement afterwards reflecting on their time there, and in the process of writing mine I realised I have a lot to say about my journey getting there in the first place. Other posts in this vein are <a href="http://blog.jfo.click/how-i-went-to-rc/">this one</a> by Jeff Fowler and <a href="http://haroldtreen.github.io/tech/recurse/2017/02/26/applying-twice-to-the-recurse-center/">this one</a> by Harold Treen.</p>
<p>At the end of 2013, I’d just completed by undergraduate degree and the CSIRO in Australia generously bent the rules for me by allowing me to do a student internship anyway. I was taking a quick break and browsing Reddit when I encountered a blog post about Hacker School. The details are in a server log somewhere, but I’m reasonably certain it was a Julia Evans post, and they’re tonally consistent on this subject so we’ll pretend it was <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/02/15/how-was-hacker-school/">this particular one</a>. I had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1dS9hoptU">an immediate and visceral reaction</a> to learning about this magical place, but because of my financial and visa situation at the time I put it in the back of my mind and mostly forgot about it.</p>
<p>Less than two years later, I became an Australian citizen. The citizenship process limits how much time you can spend overseas, but as far as I’m aware it’s open season after you get your passport sorted. I was discussing this with my mum when she asked me what I would do next with my life. Things were going pretty well for me at work and the Canberra spring was springing, so I was pretty content as I was, but she pushed for a better answer until I recalled RC. She encouraged me to apply, which for her meant nagging me every week until I submitted my application. Thanks Ma &lt;3.</p>
<p>I wasn’t accepted the first time. I was incredibly nervous and flustered during my interview, and I didn’t have a good idea of what I wanted to accomplish during my batch beyond vague ideas of learning all the Haskell. At one point my interviewer asked me how I would measure my progress, and I had no idea. I even thought I did okay and the rejection email stung when it arrived a few days later. However, I still believed that I was a good fit for RC. It helped that the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/faq">FAQ</a> states “It’s not uncommon […] to admit people who we had previously rejected”. I decided to reapply in a few months.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I realised I didn’t have to wait until RC to begin learning Haskell. I was a regular attendee of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CanFPG/">CanFP</a> but still unsure of how to bridge the gap between learning about lenses and monads and writing real code that does things. I considered myself a pretty decent user of Git and people talk about how Git is functional, so I offered to give <a href="http://vaibhavsagar.com/git-it-going/">a presentation I had prepared before</a> a second time. The co-founder I spoke to didn’t like that idea, but he had been looking into how Git is implemented, and he said he’d love to hear a talk on Git internals in Haskell. I had my project.</p>
<p>A few months later, things had gone pear-shaped for me on the work front and we were heading into the Canberra winter. I left my job and reapplied to RC. In my mind the worst that could have happened had already happened, so I was much more relaxed. My interviewer this time had attended RC when they were like me at the end of 2013, and I think we were able to relate to each other better. I’d learned some Haskell by working on my Git thing, which I called <a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/duffer/tree/4e4beb35f39d957ff1ccaf187dee3272deb58870">duffer</a> and I progressed to the pairing interview. The pairing interview was my first experience pair programming, and I think it went well, because I got an acceptance email this time.</p>
<p>Although I was applying in April, I applied to the batch starting in August because my mum’s 50th birthday was in July and attending that was non-negotiable. I was skeptical of my ability to line up a job starting in November and it didn’t make sense to hang out in Canberra with nothing to do, so I packed up my life and moved (and myself) back to Jakarta.</p>
<p>I’d given the <a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/duffer/blob/7a312355ebeacc38f553c71afcd90b3941c0069c/presentation/presentation.md">presentation on duffer</a> but it turned out that Haskell and Git were both more interesting than I realised, and so I continued working on it.</p>
<p>Both my parents <a href="http://infotech.co.id/">work in IT</a> so their hope was that I would be able to help them with some projects they were working on until I left for my batch. Instead, what I ended up doing was showing up at work and ignoring them for the rest of the day in favour of my project. This was not the best idea for my relationship with my parents, but I definitely got a lot better at Haskell. Fortunately for me my parents are incredibly supportive :).</p>
<p>My mum celebrated her birthday in Bali, and I insisted on bringing my laptop so I could keep my Github commit streak going. This turned out to a good decision because that day the RC mailing list thread welcoming new batchlings was started. I ducked out of celebrations and spent a while agonising over the perfect introduction.</p>
<p>Two weeks later I was in New York.</p>

</div>

<p>The <a href="http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/Server.html#nested-apis">meat of the Servant tutorial</a> starts with an imposing list of language extensions and imports and only gets more confusing from there. I don’t think this gives newbies (i.e. me) the best first impression of Servant. Let’s build the simplest possible key-value store with it instead.</p>
<p>We’re going to write this as a <code>stack</code> script so everything is in one file.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co">#!/usr/bin/env stack</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s import the modules we need.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="co">{- stack --resolver lts-7 --install-ghc runghc</span>
<span class="co">    --package aeson</span>
<span class="co">    --package servant-server</span>
<span class="co">    --package text</span>
<span class="co">    --package transformers</span>
<span class="co">    --package unordered-containers</span>
<span class="co">    --package warp</span>
<span class="co">    -}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>At minimum we need <code>servant-server</code> for Servant goodness and <code>warp</code> to actually run our web service. The plan is to create an <code>IORef</code> holding a <code>HashMap</code> and use that as our store, which is why we need <code>unordered-containers</code>. I’d like to store arbitrary JSON, therefore <code>aeson</code>, and I think our keys should be <code>Text</code>, because <code>aeson</code> and <code>Text</code> are great together. That leaves <code>transformers</code>, which we need because of <code>liftIO</code>.</p>
<p>It turns out that we only need two language extensions for this example.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}</span>
<span class="ot">{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As far as I can tell, both these extensions are needed for Servant’s cute API specification EDSL. We’ll let you have this one, Servant.</p>
<p>Time for a (hopefully manageable) list of imports!</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">module</span> <span class="dt">Main</span> <span class="kw">where</span>

<span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Control.Monad.IO.Class</span>   (liftIO)
<span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Data.Aeson</span>               (<span class="dt">Value</span>)
<span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Data.IORef</span>               (<span class="dt">IORef</span>, newIORef, readIORef, atomicModifyIORef&#39;)
<span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Data.HashMap.Strict</span>      (<span class="dt">HashMap</span>, lookup, insert, empty)
<span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Data.Text</span>                (<span class="dt">Text</span>)
<span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Network.Wai.Handler.Warp</span> (run)
<span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">System.Environment</span>       (getArgs)
<span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Prelude</span> <span class="kw">hiding</span>           (lookup)
<span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Servant</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All imports are explicit except <code>Servant</code>’s.</p>
<p>Speaking of the EDSL:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">type</span> <span class="dt">API</span>
    <span class="fu">=</span>    <span class="st">&quot;get&quot;</span> <span class="fu">:&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Capture</span> <span class="st">&quot;key&quot;</span> <span class="dt">Text</span> <span class="fu">:&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Get</span> <span class="ch">&#39;[JSON] (Maybe Value)</span>
    <span class="fu">:&lt;|&gt;</span> <span class="st">&quot;put&quot;</span> <span class="fu">:&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Capture</span> <span class="st">&quot;key&quot;</span> <span class="dt">Text</span>
        <span class="fu">:&gt;</span> <span class="dt">ReqBody</span> <span class="ch">&#39;[JSON] Value     :&gt; Put &#39;</span>[<span class="dt">JSON</span>] <span class="dt">Text</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This API has two endpoints: a “/get/:key” endpoint that provides the value associated with a key if the key exists in our store, or a “put/:key” endpoint that allows us to associate some JSON with a key, returning the key used. How this fits together is still a bit magical to me, but <a href="http://kseo.github.io/posts/2017-01-20-how-servant%27s-type-safe-links-work.html">this blog post</a> provides the best explanation I’ve read so far. The section of the Servant tutorial <a href="http://haskell-servant.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/ApiType.html">on the API specification EDSL</a> is also quite good.</p>
<p>Let’s define a type synonym so we don’t have to keep writing <code>IORef (HashMap Text Value)</code> over and over again:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">type</span> <span class="dt">Store</span> <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">IORef</span> (<span class="dt">HashMap</span> <span class="dt">Text</span> <span class="dt">Value</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Servant uses the same operator to define the type and the serving action:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">server ::</span> <span class="dt">Store</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Server</span> <span class="dt">API</span>
server store <span class="fu">=</span> getValue store <span class="fu">:&lt;|&gt;</span> putValue store</code></pre></div>
<p>The order in which these actions are composed needs to match the order used in the API definition.</p>
<p>Next we define <code>getValue</code> and <code>putValue</code>. We need actions of type <code>Handler</code>, which is <code>ExceptT ServantErr IO</code>, so we <code>liftIO</code> as necessary:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">getValue ::</span> <span class="dt">Store</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Text</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Handler</span> (<span class="dt">Maybe</span> <span class="dt">Value</span>)
getValue store key <span class="fu">=</span> liftIO <span class="fu">$</span> lookup key <span class="fu">&lt;$&gt;</span> readIORef store

<span class="ot">putValue ::</span> <span class="dt">Store</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Text</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Value</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Handler</span> <span class="dt">Text</span>
putValue store key value <span class="fu">=</span> liftIO <span class="fu">$</span> atomicModifyIORef&#39; store modify
    <span class="kw">where</span> modify kv <span class="fu">=</span> (insert key value kv, key)</code></pre></div>
<p>Almost there. We declare the API we want to serve:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">kvAPI ::</span> <span class="dt">Proxy</span> <span class="dt">API</span>
kvAPI <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Proxy</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once again, Kwang Yul Seo has <a href="http://kseo.github.io/posts/2017-01-15-data-proxy.html">a great blog post</a> on this.</p>
<p>Finally, we define our entry point:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">main ::</span> <span class="dt">IO</span> ()
main <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
    port <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> read <span class="fu">.</span> head <span class="fu">&lt;$&gt;</span><span class="ot"> getArgs ::</span> <span class="dt">IO</span> <span class="dt">Int</span>
    run port <span class="fu">.</span> serve kvAPI <span class="fu">.</span> server <span class="fu">=&lt;&lt;</span> newIORef empty</code></pre></div>
<p>To recap: we define our API as a type, our handlers, and the type we want to serve, and then we plug it all together.</p>
<p>And we’re done! We can now <code>chmod +x KVStore.hs</code> (or whatever you called the file) and run it: <code>./KVStore.hs 8081</code>.</p>
<p>I hope this provides a better starting point for learning Servant. If desired, the full script is available <a href="https://gist.github.com/vaibhavsagar/694e0a823c5a4a5b52ddb4277b55ba1d">here</a>.</p>

        Tags: <a href="/blog/tags/programming/index.html">programming</a>, <a href="/blog/tags/haskell/index.html">haskell</a>, <a href="/blog/tags/monads/index.html">monads</a>
    
</div>

<p>I think becoming familiar with the mechanics of working with monads is more important than the question of what a monad is. For this reason, I think monad tutorials solve the wrong problem. I’m giving you a monad anti-tutorial instead, where I don’t try to explain what a monad is but I do try to show you how to use them.</p>
<p>I’m assuming basic familiarity with Haskell’s syntax, but even if you’re not I hope you’ll still be able to follow this.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a definition. <code>Monad</code> in Haskell is a typeclass, which is very much like an interface in many other languages. Because Haskell is not object-oriented, it has types conform to typeclasses instead of objects conforming to interfaces, and each type can declare that it implements a particular typeclass by supplying definitions for each function that the typeclass specifies. <code>Monad</code> looks very much like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">class</span> <span class="dt">Monad</span> m <span class="kw">where</span>
<span class="ot">    return ::</span> a   <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m a
<span class="ot">    (&gt;&gt;=)  ::</span> m a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> (a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m b) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> m b</code></pre></div>
<p>This means that for any type <code>m</code>, if you provide two function definitions called <code>return</code> and <code>(&gt;&gt;=)</code> (pronounced ‘bind’) with the correct type signatures, you’ve made a <code>Monad</code> instance!</p>
<p>There are two things I think are confusing about this definition:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><code>return</code> is a regular function whose meaning is unrelated to the <code>return</code> statement in most other programming languages.</p></li>
<li><p>Haskell allows you to define infix operators by surrounding them in parentheses, and this one looks a bit odd and vaguely threatening with its spiky edges.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are some laws that well-behaved implementations are supposed to observe:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">return a <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> f           <span class="fu">=</span>  f a
m <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> return             <span class="fu">=</span>  m
m <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> (\x <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> f x <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> g)  <span class="fu">=</span>  (m <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> f) <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> g</code></pre></div>
<p>I include these because they’re an important part of what a <code>Monad</code> is. These laws aren’t enforced by the typeclass definition so it is possible to define unlawful instances. That’s a very bad idea though.</p>
<p>And that’s all. Really.</p>
<p>So what’s all the hype about?</p>
<p>One reason might be that Haskell has syntax sugar for this particular typeclass. This syntax sugar is known as <code>do</code>-notation, and it allows you to write code that looks like</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">foo a b <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
    a&#39; <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> a
    b&#39; <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> b
    return (a&#39; <span class="fu">+</span> b&#39;)</code></pre></div>
<p>that then gets rewritten to</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">foo a b <span class="fu">=</span>
    a <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> \a&#39; <span class="ot">-&gt;</span>
    b <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> \b&#39; <span class="ot">-&gt;</span>
    return (a&#39; <span class="fu">+</span> b&#39;)</code></pre></div>
<p>If you want to define variables in between you can use</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">bar a b <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
    a&#39; <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> a
    <span class="kw">let</span> a&#39;&#39; <span class="fu">=</span> a&#39; <span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span>
    b&#39; <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> b
    return (a&#39;&#39; <span class="fu">+</span> b&#39;)</code></pre></div>
<p>and this becomes</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">bar a b <span class="fu">=</span>
    a <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> \a&#39; <span class="ot">-&gt;</span>
    <span class="kw">let</span> a&#39;&#39; <span class="fu">=</span> a&#39; <span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span> <span class="kw">in</span>
    b <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> \b&#39; <span class="ot">-&gt;</span>
    return (a&#39;&#39; <span class="fu">+</span> b)</code></pre></div>
<p>Sometimes you don’t care about the variable on the left hand side of the <code>&lt;-</code>, and you can omit it like</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">baz a b <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
    a
    b&#39; <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> b
    return b&#39;</code></pre></div>
<p>which desugars to</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">baz a b <span class="fu">=</span>
    a <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> \_  <span class="ot">-&gt;</span>
    b <span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span> \b&#39; <span class="ot">-&gt;</span>
    return b&#39;</code></pre></div>
<p>I’ll be using the above definitions in my examples, so if you find yourself wondering where <code>bar</code> came from a bit later, check back here.</p>
<p>I think it’s worth spending time on understanding <code>do</code> notation and converting between the sugared and desugared representations because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Familiarity with <code>do</code> notation will allow you to effectively use monads, whether or not you feel you understand them.</p></li>
<li><p>Doing this will teach you (or at least help you learn) the monad laws.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But enough about that. Let’s walk through some contrived examples to see how we can use the same typeclass (and the same functions) to do a bunch of very different things!</p>
<p>I’d like to start with the <code>Maybe</code> type, which allows us to work with possibly <code>null</code> values in a way I think is better than most other approaches. The implementation (or <code>instance</code>) of <code>Monad</code> looks like</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">instance</span> <span class="dt">Monad</span> <span class="dt">Maybe</span> <span class="kw">where</span>
    return v         <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Just</span> v
    (<span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span>) <span class="dt">Nothing</span>  _ <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Nothing</span>
    (<span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span>) (<span class="dt">Just</span> v) f <span class="fu">=</span> f v</code></pre></div>
<p>and in use it looks like</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">λ<span class="fu">&gt;</span> foo (<span class="dt">Just</span> <span class="dv">1</span>) (<span class="dt">Just</span> <span class="dv">2</span>)
<span class="dt">Just</span> <span class="dv">3</span>
λ<span class="fu">&gt;</span> foo <span class="dt">Nothing</span> (<span class="dt">Just</span> <span class="dv">2</span>)
<span class="dt">Nothing</span>
λ<span class="fu">&gt;</span> foo (<span class="dt">Just</span> <span class="dv">1</span>) <span class="dt">Nothing</span>
<span class="dt">Nothing</span>
λ<span class="fu">&gt;</span> bar (<span class="dt">Just</span> <span class="dv">1</span>) (<span class="dt">Just</span> <span class="dv">2</span>)
<span class="dt">Just</span> <span class="dv">4</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This captures the idea that if any of the parameters is <code>Nothing</code>, the overall result should also be <code>Nothing</code>. The cool part is that we don’t need to worry about this when defining <code>foo</code>, because the underlying implementation takes care of it for us.</p>
<p>In a language like Python, we don’t really have a way to abstract away the fact that an input can be possibly null, and we have to specifically account for this possibility. Similar code in Python would look like</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> foo(a, b):
   <span class="cf">if</span> a <span class="kw">is</span> <span class="kw">not</span> <span class="va">None</span> <span class="kw">and</span> b <span class="kw">is</span> <span class="kw">not</span> <span class="va">None</span>:
      <span class="cf">return</span> a <span class="op">+</span> b
   <span class="cf">else</span>:
      <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="va">None</span></code></pre></div>
<p>and this code would not work without modification for any of the following examples.</p>
<p>A second example is the <code>List</code> type. A valid instance looks like</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">instance</span> <span class="dt">Monad</span> [] <span class="kw">where</span>
    return v   <span class="fu">=</span> [v]
    (<span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span>)  v f <span class="fu">=</span> concatMap f v</code></pre></div>
<p>and you would use this like</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">λ<span class="fu">&gt;</span> foo [<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>] [<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>]
[<span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>, <span class="dv">5</span>, <span class="dv">6</span>]
λ<span class="fu">&gt;</span> foo [] [<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>]
[]
λ<span class="fu">&gt;</span> bar [<span class="dv">1</span>, <span class="dv">2</span>] [<span class="dv">2</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>, <span class="dv">4</span>]
[<span class="dv">4</span>,<span class="dv">5</span>,<span class="dv">6</span>,<span class="dv">5</span>,<span class="dv">6</span>,<span class="dv">7</span>]</code></pre></div>
<p>Where a <code>Maybe</code> can be one of two possible values, a <code>List</code> is an arbitrary number of values.</p>
<p>In Python this would be a list comprehension:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> foo(a, b):
   <span class="cf">return</span> [a_<span class="op">+</span>b_ <span class="cf">for</span> a_ <span class="kw">in</span> a <span class="cf">for</span> b_ <span class="kw">in</span> b]</code></pre></div>
<p>which, again, is too specific to work with any of the other examples.</p>
<p>The <code>Maybe</code> type could be thought of as a box containing either one or no elements, and similarly <code>List</code> may be thought of as a box containing an arbitrary number of elements. It may be tempting to think of all monads as boxes of some kind, but monads are more general than that. Let’s look at the <code>Reader</code> type, which allows us to <code>ask</code> for some value that can be passed in later (in some circles this is called dependency injection):</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Reader</span> e a <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Reader</span> {<span class="ot">runReader ::</span> e <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a}

ask <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Reader</span> (\e <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> e)

<span class="kw">instance</span> <span class="dt">Monad</span> (<span class="dt">Reader</span> e) <span class="kw">where</span>
   return a           <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Reader</span> (\_ <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a)
   (<span class="fu">&gt;&gt;=</span>) (<span class="dt">Reader</span> r) f <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">Reader</span> (\e <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> runReader (f (r e)) e)</code></pre></div>
<p>I had to look this one up. I don’t expect you to immediately understand this implementation, my point is that this is bog-standard Haskell code. It’s a bit more interesting to use:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">x <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
   value <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> ask
   return (value <span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span>)

y <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
   value <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> ask
   return (value <span class="fu">+</span> <span class="dv">2</span>)

λ<span class="fu">&gt;</span> runReader (foo x y) <span class="dv">1</span>
<span class="dv">5</span>
λ<span class="fu">&gt;</span> runReader (foo x y) <span class="dv">2</span>
<span class="dv">7</span>
λ<span class="fu">&gt;</span> runReader (bar x y) <span class="dv">1</span>
<span class="dv">6</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I have no idea how you’d do this in Python, but I can guarantee it’s not general either.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s look at the <code>IO</code> type, which I find a bit scary. I don’t really understand how it’s implemented. so I’ll be skipping that section. Fortunately, we know how to use it, because we are familiar with the interface, so let’s go straight to that.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">getInt <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
   input <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> baz (putStr <span class="st">&quot;Enter integer: &quot;</span>) getLine
   <span class="kw">let</span> int <span class="fu">=</span> read<span class="ot"> input ::</span> <span class="dt">Int</span>
   return int

λ<span class="fu">&gt;</span> foo getInt getInt
<span class="dt">Enter</span> integer<span class="fu">:</span> <span class="dv">1</span>
<span class="dt">Enter</span> integer<span class="fu">:</span> <span class="dv">2</span>
<span class="dv">3</span>
λ<span class="fu">&gt;</span> bar getInt getInt
<span class="dt">Enter</span> integer<span class="fu">:</span> <span class="dv">1</span>
<span class="dt">Enter</span> integer<span class="fu">:</span> <span class="dv">2</span>
<span class="dv">4</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Okay, enough examples. As you can see, we’ve used the same interface to deal with failure, an arbitrary number of values, an extra parameter, and input/output. There are many useful monad instances in Haskell, from container types such as Set and Map to abstractions such as Writer and State, through to control flow as implemented by the Cont monad.</p>
<p>If you can make your type conform to the typeclass, Haskell will give you a pretty general and flexible API to work with it. Even if you don’t completely understand what’s going on with a certain type, you know enough to use it based on your knowledge of the interface. As far as I’m concerned, this is the point of monads in Haskell.</p>

<p>Code is just smart data, and data is just dumb code.</p>

<p>I’m going to try to convince you that data is code. Strap yourselves in!</p>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cons">cons cell</a> is a way of representing a pair, and it has two operations, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAR_and_CDR"><code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code></a>, to access the first and second elements of the pair respectively. In Python, we could construct and access cons cells as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">cons <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">lambda</span> a: <span class="kw">lambda</span> b: (a, b)
car  <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">lambda</span> cell: cell[<span class="dv">0</span>]
cdr  <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">lambda</span> cell: cell[<span class="dv">1</span>]</code></pre></div>
<p>Let’s create a pair and get the second element:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> p <span class="op">=</span> cons(<span class="dv">1</span>)(cons(<span class="dv">2</span>)(()))
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> car(cdr(p))
<span class="dv">2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It turns out that cons cells are all you need to implement singly linked lists. For example, lists in Lisp are implemented as a series of nested cons cells. A list is either empty (represented above by <code>()</code>) or a cons cell where the first element of the pair is the head of the list and the second element of the pair is the rest of the list. Using our above definitions in Python, the list <code>[0, 1, 2, 3]</code> would be represented as (0, (1, (2, (3, ())))). In code, this would be:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">cons(<span class="dv">0</span>)(cons(<span class="dv">1</span>)(cons(<span class="dv">2</span>)(cons(<span class="dv">3</span>)(()))))</code></pre></div>
<p>One way of visualising the above list is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>  cons
  / \
 0 cons
   / \
  1 cons
    / \
   2 cons
     / \
    3  ()</code></pre>
<p>Suppose we wanted to access the second element of this list. We could express this as the <code>car</code> of the <code>cdr</code> of this list. In code:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> example <span class="op">=</span> cons(<span class="dv">0</span>)(cons(<span class="dv">1</span>)(cons(<span class="dv">2</span>)(cons(<span class="dv">3</span>)(()))))
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> car(cdr(example))
<span class="dv">1</span></code></pre></div>
<p>So far we’ve defined functions that wrap Python’s tuples, and we’re still in data land, working with those tuples. But it doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that my definitions above were all functions of one argument. This was not entirely coincidental: cons cells as described above are very similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding#Church_pairs">Church pairs</a>, which are a way of representing pairs in the lambda calculus. Let’s make a minor change to the above definitions:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">pair <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">lambda</span> a: <span class="kw">lambda</span> b: <span class="kw">lambda</span> f: f(a)(b)
fst  <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">lambda</span> p: p(<span class="kw">lambda</span> a: <span class="kw">lambda</span> b: a)
snd  <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">lambda</span> p: p(<span class="kw">lambda</span> a: <span class="kw">lambda</span> b: b)
nil  <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">lambda</span> a: a</code></pre></div>
<p>We can recreate the pair above:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> p <span class="op">=</span> pair(<span class="dv">1</span>)(pair(<span class="dv">2</span>)(nil))
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> fst(snd(p))
<span class="dv">2</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Our pair <code>p</code> is now a function, but it is representing the same data as above.</p>
<p>As an aside, the functions we use in <code>fst</code> and <code>snd</code> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding#Church_Booleans">Church booleans</a> that encode <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> in the lambda calculus. We can rewrite our definitions with this new knowledge:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">true  <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">lambda</span> a: <span class="kw">lambda</span> b: a
false <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">lambda</span> a: <span class="kw">lambda</span> b: b
fst   <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">lambda</span> p: p(true)
snd   <span class="op">=</span> <span class="kw">lambda</span> p: p(false)</code></pre></div>
<p>We can perform the same operations as before to get the second element of our list:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> example <span class="op">=</span> pair(<span class="dv">0</span>)(pair(<span class="dv">1</span>)(pair(<span class="dv">2</span>)(pair(<span class="dv">3</span>)(nil))))
<span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> fst(snd(example))
<span class="dv">1</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we’ve moved to function land, and there are no tuples in sight. All we need are functions of one argument, which is convenient because this is all that lambda calculus gives us. Fortunately, lambda calculus is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">Turing complete</a> and therefore enough.</p>
<p>Our code is represented as bits in memory i.e. data, but our data can be represented as functions i.e. code. You might say that bits and bytes are the lowest level representation and therefore somehow more fundamental than code, but even our data is just an undistinguished pattern of 1s and 0s without some code to make sense of it. It really is turtles all the way down.</p>
<p>There are much more comprehensive treatments of this material available online. I’m aware of <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/js-church/">Matt Might’s</a> and <a href="http://jtauber.com/blog/2008/11/26/church_encoding_in_python/">James Tauber’s</a>.</p>

    <title>Using The Writer Monad Outside Logging</title>

</div>

<p>I hadn’t given much thought to the Writer monad before today, unlike the Reader and State monads, and part of the reason is that all the tutorials I encountered online focused on using it for logging. Although this is an obvious use case, I haven’t had to do much logging in Haskell so far and so I incorrectly assumed that I didn’t need to know about the Writer monad at all. However, I found a use for it outside logging and thought this might be worth sharing. This usage depends on two facts about Haskell:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Writer monad’s output can be any Monoid, such as strings, lists, sets, etc.</li>
<li>ByteString is a Monoid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Git Packfiles store some entries as deltas against other entries. The delta format is a bit hairy to parse, but it consists of a sequence of either copy or insert instructions. Copy instructions specify an offset in the source and a length of bytes to copy, whereas insert instructions specify a series of bytes to be copied as is.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">import qualified</span> <span class="dt">Data.ByteString</span> <span class="kw">as</span> <span class="dt">B</span>

<span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">DeltaInstruction</span>
    <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">CopyInstruction</span>   <span class="dt">Int</span> <span class="dt">Int</span>
    <span class="fu">|</span> <span class="dt">InsertInstruction</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span>
    <span class="kw">deriving</span> (<span class="dt">Show</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>An instruction can be interpreted with reference to a source to result in a ByteString.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">substring ::</span> <span class="dt">Int</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Int</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span>
substring offset length bytestring <span class="fu">=</span> B.take length (B.drop offset bytestring)

<span class="co">-- Under this interpretation, `InsertInstruction` corresponds to `const`</span>
<span class="co">-- and `CopyInstruction` corresponds to `substring`.</span>
<span class="ot">interpretInstruction ::</span> <span class="dt">DeltaInstruction</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span>
interpretInstruction instruction source <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">case</span> instruction <span class="kw">of</span>
    <span class="dt">InsertInstruction</span> string        <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> string
    <span class="dt">CopyInstruction</span>   offset length <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> substring offset length source</code></pre></div>
<p>The concatenation of a list of interpreted instructions is a resolved delta.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">applyInstructions&#39; ::</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [<span class="dt">DeltaInstruction</span>] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span>
applyInstructions&#39; source dest []     <span class="fu">=</span> dest
applyInstructions&#39; source dest (i<span class="fu">:</span>is) <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">let</span>
    dest&#39; <span class="fu">=</span> B.append dest <span class="fu">$</span> interpretInstruction i source
    <span class="kw">in</span> applyInstructions&#39; source dest&#39; is</code></pre></div>
<p>For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="fu">:</span>set <span class="fu">-</span><span class="dt">XOverloadedStrings</span>
testSource <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="st">&quot;tree 9977d7726a568347a513a6b061b87fd687322650\nparent e05bba28b796e7af7e5d981955327621a6c43a5f\nauthor Vaibhav Sagar &lt;EMAILADDRESS@gmail.com&gt; 1467760597 +0800\ncommitter Vaibhav Sagar &lt;EMAILADDRESS@gmail.com&gt; 1467781641 +0800\n\nUse record wildcards.\n&quot;</span><span class="ot"> ::</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span>
testInstructions <span class="fu">=</span> [<span class="dt">InsertInstruction</span> <span class="st">&quot;tree d8dce7c53feb5fcaca4bef87106d3f9e4e50e6e&quot;</span>,<span class="dt">CopyInstruction</span> <span class="dv">44</span> <span class="dv">167</span>,<span class="dt">InsertInstruction</span> <span class="st">&quot;60597&quot;</span>,<span class="dt">CopyInstruction</span> <span class="dv">216</span> <span class="dv">30</span>]
applyInstructions&#39; testSource B.empty testInstructions</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>&quot;tree d8dce7c53feb5fcaca4bef87106d3f9e4e50e6e0\nparent e05bba28b796e7af7e5d981955327621a6c43a5f\nauthor Vaibhav Sagar &lt;EMAILADDRESS@gmail.com&gt; 1467760597 +0800\ncommitter Vaibhav Sagar &lt;EMAILADDRESS@gmail.com&gt; 1467760597 +0800\n\nUse record wildcards.\n&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Although this works, it isn’t particularly elegant and it would be nice to abstract away the details of the empty ByteString and the append. Luckily, these correspond to the <code>mempty</code> and <code>mappend</code> methods of a Monoid, and since the Writer monad works with monoids, we might be able to use it. Let’s start by defining a monadic action that appends an interpreted instruction and returns the source we fed it.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Control.Monad</span>
<span class="kw">import </span><span class="dt">Control.Monad.Trans.Writer</span>

<span class="ot">applyInstruction ::</span> <span class="dt">DeltaInstruction</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Writer</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span>
applyInstruction instruction source <span class="fu">=</span> writer (source, interpretInstruction instruction source)</code></pre></div>
<p>Our action takes two parameters and so we <code>map</code> it to our list of instructions. This gives us a list of actions expecting a source buffer to operate on.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="fu">:</span>t map applyInstruction testInstructions</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>map applyInstruction testInstructions :: [ByteString -&gt; Writer ByteString ByteString]</code></pre>
<p>We need to reduce this list to a single value while executing each action in sequence, which implies a fold. <code>foldM</code> looks like what we need; according to the documentation:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">foldM f a1 [x1, x2, <span class="fu">...</span>, xm] <span class="fu">==</span>
<span class="kw">do</span>
    a2 <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> f a1 x1
    a3 <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> f a2 x2
    <span class="fu">...</span>
    f am xm</code></pre></div>
<p>The only wrinkle is that <code>f</code> needs to take the argument first and the action second. We can accomplish this by defining</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">f a b <span class="fu">=</span> b a</code></pre></div>
<p>or</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">f <span class="fu">=</span> flip (<span class="fu">$</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Putting it all together, we have</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span class="ot">applyInstructions ::</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [<span class="dt">DeltaInstruction</span>] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">B.ByteString</span>
applyInstructions source instructions <span class="fu">=</span> execWriter <span class="fu">$</span> foldM (flip (<span class="fu">$</span>)) source <span class="fu">$</span> map applyInstruction instructions
applyInstructions testSource testInstructions <span class="fu">==</span> applyInstructions&#39; testSource B.empty testInstructions</code></pre></div>
<pre><code>True</code></pre>
<p>And there you have it, a use of Writer that has absolutely nothing to do with logging!</p>
