</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>You wouldn't know it from looking at my blog, but I attended a batch at the
Recurse Center from August to early November last year, and it was the best
experience of my life. Many Recursers write a return statement afterwards
reflecting on their time there, and in the process of writing mine I realised I
have a lot to say about my journey getting there in the first place. Other
posts in this vein are <a href="http://blog.jfo.click/how-i-went-to-rc/">this one</a> by
Jeff Fowler and <a href="http://haroldtreen.github.io/tech/recurse/2017/02/26/applying-twice-to-the-recurse-center/">this
one</a>
by Harold Treen.</p>
<p>At the end of 2013, the CSIRO in Australia generously bent the rules for me by
allowing me to do a student internship despite having just completed an
undergraduate degree. I was repaying this generosity by slacking off on work
time and reading blog posts on Reddit (as you do) when I encountered a blog
post about Hacker School. The details are in a server log somewhere, but I'm
reasonably certain it was a Julia Evans post, and they're tonally consistent on
this subject so we'll pretend it was <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/02/15/how-was-hacker-school/">this particular
one</a>. I had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2p1dS9hoptU">an
immediate and visceral reaction</a>
to learning about this magical place, but because of my financial and visa
situation at the time I put it in the back of my mind and mostly forgot about
it.</p>
<p>Less than two years later, I became an Australian citizen. The citizenship
process limits how much time you can spend overseas, but as far as I'm aware
it's open season after you get your passport sorted. I was discussing this with
my mum when she asked me what I would do next with my life. Things were going
pretty well for me at work and the Canberra spring was springing, so I was
pretty content as I was, but she pushed for a better answer until I recalled
RC. She encouraged me to apply, which for her meant nagging me every week until
I submitted my application. Thanks Ma &lt;3.</p>
<p>I wasn't accepted the first time. I was incredibly nervous and flustered during
my interview, and I didn't have a good idea of what I wanted to accomplish
during my batch beyond vague ideas of learning all the Haskell. At one point my
interviewer asked me how I would measure my progress, and I had no idea. I even
thought I did okay and the rejection email stung when it arrived a few days
later. However, I still believed that I was a good fit for RC. It helped that
the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/faq">FAQ</a> states "It's not uncommon [...] to admit
people who we had previously rejected". I decided to reapply in a few months.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I realised I didn't have to wait until RC to begin learning
Haskell. I was a regular attendee of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CanFPG/">CanFP</a>
but still unsure of how to bridge the gap between learning about lenses and
monads and writing real code that does things. I considered myself a pretty
decent user of Git and people talk about how Git is functional, so I
offered to give <a href="http://vaibhavsagar.com/git-it-going/">a presentation I had prepared
before</a> a second time. The co-founder I
spoke to didn't like that idea, but he had been looking into how Git is
implemented, and he said he'd love to hear a talk on Git internals in Haskell.
I had my project.</p>
<p>A few months later, things had gone pear-shaped for me on the work front. I
left my job and reapplied to RC. In my mind the worst that could have happened
had already happened, so I was much more relaxed. My interviewer this time had
attended RC when they were like me at the end of 2013, and I think we were able
to relate to each other better. I'd learned some Haskell by working on my Git
thing, which I called
<a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/duffer/tree/4e4beb35f39d957ff1ccaf187dee3272deb58870">duffer</a>
and I progressed to the pairing interview. The pairing interview was my first
experience pair programming, and I think it went well, because I got an
acceptance email this time.</p>
<p>Although I was applying in April, I applied to the batch starting in August
because my mum's 50th birthday was in July and attending that was
non-negotiable. I was skeptical of my ability to line up a job starting in
November and it didn't make sense to hang out in Canberra with nothing to do,
so I packed up my life and moved (and myself) back to Jakarta.</p>
<p>I'd given the <a href="https://github.com/vaibhavsagar/duffer/blob/7a312355ebeacc38f553c71afcd90b3941c0069c/presentation/presentation.md">presentation on duffer</a>
but it turned out that Haskell and Git were both more interesting than I
realised, and so I continued working on it.</p>
<p>Both my parents <a href="http://infotech.co.id/">work in IT</a> so their hope was that I
would be able to help them with some projects they were working on until I left
for my batch. Instead, what I ended up doing was showing up at work and
ignoring them for the rest of the day in favour of Haskell. This was not the
best idea, but I definitely got a lot better at Haskell.</p>
<p>My mum celebrated her birthday in Bali, and I insisted on bringing my laptop so
I could keep my Github commit streak going. This turned out to a good decision
because that day the RC mailing list thread welcoming new batchlings
was started. I ducked out of celebrations and spent a while agonising over the
perfect introduction.</p>
<p>Two weeks later I was in New York.</p><p>There are <a href="http://www.vaibhavsagar.com/blog/2017/02/26/getting-to-rc/#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>                </article>
