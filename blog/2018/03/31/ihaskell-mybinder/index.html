<p><a href="https://mybinder.org/">mybinder.org</a> is a website that will freely host a GitHub repository as a collection of interactive Jupyter notebooks. It has excellent built-in support for some of the more popular Jupyter kernels such as Python and Julia, but it also has support for building a <code>Dockerfile</code> of your choosing.</p>
<p>This means that getting an IHaskell installation up and running can be as simple as clicking a link, and I’m happy to report that I’ve gotten this working! You can <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gibiansky/IHaskell/master">try it here</a>.</p>
<p>I started with the simplest thing I could think of, which was to install system dependencies and Jupyter to an Ubuntu container and then run <code>stack install ihaskell</code>.</p>
<p>Once I had that working, my next step was to roll these changes into <a href="https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell/pull/848">IHaskell’s <code>Dockerfile</code></a> and now everyone can use IHaskell on mybinder.org!</p>
<p>I’ve also <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/vaibhavsagar/ihaskell/">pushed an image to Docker Hub</a> that you can use as a base for your own repositories. A minimal example of a valid <code>Dockerfile</code> looks something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode dockerfile"><code class="sourceCode dockerfile"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a><span class="kw">FROM</span> vaibhavsagar/ihaskell:4afa0aee339e</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Ideally I would also like to get this running with Nix, because that approach results in a much smaller image and is easily extensible just by editing <code>default.nix</code>. I have a small repo that builds but doesn’t run on mybinder.org, and I’ve <a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binder/issues/87">opened an issue</a>.</p>
<p>I’m pretty excited about what this means for the Jupyter ecosystem and IHaskell in particular, and I’m looking forward to seeing what other people do with this!</p>
