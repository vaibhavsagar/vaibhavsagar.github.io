<p>IHaskell is now available on <a href="https://cocalc.com/">CoCalc</a>! I’m excited that there are even more options for creating your own IHaskell notebooks without having to install anything.</p>
<p>This is the result of a long collaboration with the lovely people at CoCalc, particularly <a href="https://wstein.org/">William Stein</a> and <a href="http://harald.schil.ly/">Harald Schilly</a>. I’d like to say a little about how this happened, but if you’re not interested you can stop reading here!</p>
<p>During the wonderful and magical time that was my batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=5ac465e5d3396a7e491e42afac4c5c90">Recurse Center</a>, I fulfilled a long-term goal of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsNnP3we_R4">speaking at the NYHUG</a>. I was particularly enthusiastic about IHaskell, and <a href="http://gbaz.github.io/">Gershom</a> mentioned that people at SageMathCloud were interested in <a href="https://github.com/sagemathinc/cocalc/issues/125">getting it working</a> and offered to put me in touch.</p>
<p>I immediately encountered an issue where <a href="https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell/issues/694">IHaskell wasn’t handling all valid inputs</a> and complained about it on <a href="https://www.recurse.com/blog/112-how-rc-uses-zulip">Zulip</a>. I woke up the next day to find that <a href="https://twitter.com/horrorcheck">Libby Horacek</a> had gone ahead and <a href="https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell/pull/697">fixed the issue</a>. What a legend! This was also my first open-source contribution to a Haskell project ever.</p>
<p>I then tried the obvious thing, <code>stack build &amp;&amp; stack install</code> which resulted in a working notebook but an impossible deploy, because they needed the whole installation to be self-contained whereas Stack stores some things in <code>~/.stack</code> and other things in <code>&lt;project&gt;/.stack-work</code>. I (incorrectly) assumed that having <code>ihaskell</code> be a static binary would fix the issue, so then I spent a few weeks faffing around with <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2016/10/static-compilation-with-stack">this</a> which resulted in a static binary and made no difference otherwise.</p>
<p>Frustrated that my first attempt failed, I went silent for a while. My batch ended, I was unemployed for a few more months, I started a new role, and I moved to a new country. Because <a href="https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell/pull/716#issuecomment-305934463">I asked at the right time</a>, I became a maintainer of IHaskell and we finally got GHC 8 support! We also dropped GHC 7.10 support, which was <a href="https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell/pull/747">controversial</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime SageMathCloud rebranded to CoCalc and revamped its infrastructure, and <a href="https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell/issues/731">they put the feelers out to try again</a>.</p>
<p>I saw that they were still running GHC 7.10 and went silent again, because I didn’t want to use an old version of IHaskell or have the discussion about installing a newer GHC just so I could fiddle some more. Instead, I worked on keeping IHaskell up-to-date and making it easier to use, with PRs for <a href="https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell/pull/735">GHC 8.2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell/pull/817">GHC 8.4</a> and supporting installation with Nix.</p>
<p>Despite my best efforts, I was still getting lots of questions about installing IHaskell and I got fed up and <a href="https://twitter.com/vbhvsgr/status/975388161898561536">whinged about it on Twitter</a>. In response, Gershom DMed me to ask how the CoCalc stuff was progressing, after which I got back in touch and asked for a newer version of GHC. They obliged with GHC 8.4.</p>
<p>By this time we had realised that Stack wasn’t going to work, so we tried old-style Cabal and new-style Cabal, which both have similar issues with dependencies in <code>~/.cabal</code>. Finally Harald suggested using <code>cabal sandbox</code> and we were able to come up with a working, self-contained IHaskell install.</p>
<p>This would have been impossible without the patience and generosity of everyone involved. All told, it took almost a year and a half to get this working, which doesn’t come across in the <a href="https://twitter.com/cocalc_com/status/982650432928583680">announcement</a>.</p>
